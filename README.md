#Backend Token is not defining 

1. **Cross-Origin Issues**:
   - If your frontend and backend are hosted on different domains or subdomains in production, `sameSite: 'strict'` could be preventing the cookie from being sent with requests. In cross-origin contexts, consider using `sameSite: 'None'` and `Secure: true`.
   - Update the cookie settings like so:
     ```javascript
     res.cookie('token', token, {
       httpOnly: true,
       sameSite: 'None',
       secure: true,  // Ensure HTTPS is enabled in production
       maxAge: 1 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
     });
     ```

2. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Ensure your backend is set up to allow CORS with credentials. In your backend (e.g., using Express), configure CORS as follows:
     ```javascript
     const cors = require('cors');
     app.use(cors({
       origin: 'https://your-frontend-domain.com',
       credentials: true
     }));
     ```
   - On the frontend, when making requests (e.g., using Axios), include the `withCredentials` option:
     ```javascript
     axios.get('https://your-backend-url.com/api', { withCredentials: true });
     ```

3. **Environment-Specific HTTPS**:
   - Ensure that `secure: true` is only set when using HTTPS in production. Otherwise, cookies wonâ€™t be sent in insecure (HTTP) environments.
